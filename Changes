Revision history for Text::XmlMatch

0.0001    02/16/07 First version.

0.0002    02/06/07 Correct POD section.  No tag means hash value = '0'

0.0003    02/07/07 Corrected bug where config file with a single
                   pattern caused the module to fail.

0.0004    02/12/07 Minor POD cleanup, added 'use warnings'

0.0005    06/06/07 Corrected bug where a single pattern name causes
		   listGroups() to misbehave.  Also, the following
		   keywords are now reserved and must not be used as
		   pattern names:  'name', 'tag', and 'inclusion'.

0.0006    06/06/07 listGroups() bug was not truly stomped.  Should be
                   dead for good now.
